Description: A Shiny web application that functions as a visual interface for a variety of microbiome analysis and visualization functions.
    It is primarily based on the phyloseq and microbiome libraries, and makes use of plotly to generate interactive plots from a ggplot2 output.
    All tables and plots can be saved individually, albeit the final report function is currently incomplete and a work-in-progress.
