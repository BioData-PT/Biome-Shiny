## BioData.pt Community Tools - Contributor Code of Conduct

This Code of Conduct has been partially adapted from BioData.pt's Code of Conduct for Events, itself adapted from the ELIXIR Hub Code of Conduct for Events, as well as dev.to.

## Applicability

All contributors (including project maintainers, non-BioData.pt code contributors and bug report submitters, etc.) to the development of BioData.pt Community Tools (such as Biome-Shiny, D-Cellerate and D-Fferential, as well as others) are expected to abide by the Code of Conduct, both online and during in-person events related to the usage of these tools, such as courses, presentations or seminars.

## Our values: a place to feel respected, a place to feel safe

The opportunity to bring together differing perspectives is one of BioData.pt’s greatest assets. BioData.pt wishes to attract and develop a diverse pool of talent, and to leverage the rich variety of experience, skills and potential of all employees associated with it. Therefore it is a prerequisite that BioData.pt provides for a safe environment that allows everyone to feel respected and included, and receive equitable treatment by others. BioData.pt works to maintain a modern, inclusive environment where people value diversity, foster dignity and respect, take each other’s perspectives into account and feel comfortable being themselves – regardless of characteristics including gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, age or working experience, physical or mental challenges, physical appearance, body size, pregnancy, familial status, ethnicity, national origin, race, citizenship, language, socio-economic status, experience level, political opinion, religious beliefs (or lack thereof) or educational or social background. As a statement of principle, BioData.pt rejects discrimination based on any such factors. In addition, BioData.pt opposes all forms of bullying including threatening, humiliating, coercive, or intimidating conduct that causes harm to, interferes with, or sabotages scientific activities, reputations and careers. Discrimination, harassment (in any form), and bullying create a hostile environment that reduces the quality, integrity, and pace of the advancement of science by marginalizing individuals and communities. It also damages productivity and career advancement, and prevents the healthy exchange of ideas.

## Expected behaviour

All contributors to the development of BioData.pt Community Tools are expected to display behaviour that encourages and contributes to the creation of a positive environment. This includes:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language;
- Being respectful of different viewpoints and experiences;
- Fostering scientific and technical rigour and curiosity with constructive and facts-based critique;
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism;
- Contributing work that ensures development progresses smoothly;
- Focusing on what is best for BioData.pt;


## Unacceptable behaviour

- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, public or private harassment;
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission;
- The usage of sexualised language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances;
- Demonstrating graphical or disturbing content;
- Incitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm;
- Usage of the GitHub issue tracker to engage in any of the above-mentioned behavior, rather than for its intended use.
- Deliberate false accusations - the purpose of this Code of Conduct is to protect participants against misconduct, it is not in place to resolve personal disagreements.

## Enforcement

The BioData.pt Executive Director is responsible for enforcing the Code of Conduct with the aim of avoiding all incidents of assault, harassment or any other form of inappropriate and uncivil behaviour.
If an individual experiences or witnesses any unacceptable behaviour, they should, to the extent possible, inform the alleged offender about which behaviour has impacted or is impacting them and ask to stop.
As an alternative, or if approaching the alleged offender was unsuccessful, the individual may contact Ana Portugal Melo, BioData.pt Executive Director, at executivedirector@biodata.pt.
All complaints will be treated seriously and reviewed and responded to promptly by the BioData.pt Executive Director and will be kept confidential unless disclosure is legally required.
If a contributor engages in any of these harassing behaviours, BioData.pt members or personnel, with authorization of the Executive Director, may take appropriate action to stop the misbehaviour at once and/or reduce the likelihood that the misbehaviour will happen again in the future.
